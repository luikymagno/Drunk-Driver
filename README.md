#Brief Description of the project
    In order to avoid car crashes and worse accidents due to drunk people driving theirs cars. We propose a device to detect the driver's alcohol levels.
    The ideia is to identify whether the driver is drunk or not. If he is drunk, the equipament prevent the car of turning on and, as an ideia not set in concrete yet, sending a message to the authorities, for instance, warning them what has happened.
